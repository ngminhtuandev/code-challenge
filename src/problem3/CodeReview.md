## Code Review
Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues found in your React component, now organized with each distinct issue highlighted in its own code block.

### Issue 1: Incomplete `WalletBalance` Interface
The `WalletBalance` interface is missing the `blockchain` property. This  creates a type-checking error and would lead to a runtime error in other parts of the application that rely on this property to filter and sort balances. The corrected code adds the required property to ensure the interface accurately reflects the data structure needed for the component's functionality.

#### Original Code:

```jsx
interface WalletBalance {
  currency: string;
  amount: number;
  // ❌ ERROR: Missing `blockchain` property
}
```

#### Corrected Code:

```jsx
interface WalletBalance {
  currency: string;
  amount: number;
  blockchain: string; // ✅ Added `blockchain` for type safety and functional completeness.
}
```

### Issue 2: Flawed Data Processing in `useMemo` Hook
This code block contains several logical and functional errors within the useMemo pipeline. The filter function will cause a runtime error due to an undefined variable and contains inverted logic, failing to correctly remove invalid balances. Additionally, the sort function is incomplete, which can result in an unstable and unpredictable sort order. Lastly, the useMemo hook's dependency array is incorrect, leading to unnecessary re-computations of the sorted list.

#### Original Code:
```jsx
const sortedBalances = useMemo(() => {
  return balances.filter((balance: WalletBalance) => {
    const balancePriority = getPriority(balance.blockchain);
    // ❌ ERROR: `lhsPriority` is not defined. This will cause a runtime error.
    if (lhsPriority > -99) {
      // ❌ ERROR: The logic here is inverted. This condition keeps amounts that are <= 0.
      if (balance.amount <= 0) {
        return true;
      }
    }
    return false
  }).sort((lhs: WalletBalance, rhs: WalletBalance) => {
    const leftPriority = getPriority(lhs.blockchain);
    const rightPriority = getPriority(rhs.blockchain);
    if (leftPriority > rightPriority) {
      return -1;
    } else if (rightPriority > leftPriority) {
      return 1;
    }
    // ❌ ERROR: Missing `return 0;` for when priorities are equal. This can lead to an unstable sort.
  });
// ❌ ERROR: `prices` is not used in this calculation, making it an unnecessary dependency.
}, [balances, prices]);
```

#### Corrected Code:
```jsx
const sortedBalances = useMemo(() => {
  return balances
    .filter((balance: WalletBalance) => {
      const priority = getPriority(balance.blockchain);
      // ✅ Corrected filter logic: Keep the balance if the priority is valid AND the amount is positive.
      return priority > -99 && balance.amount > 0;
    })
    .sort((lhs: WalletBalance, rhs: WalletBalance) => {
      const leftPriority = getPriority(lhs.blockchain);
      const rightPriority = getPriority(rhs.blockchain);
      // ✅ Corrected sort logic: This concise syntax handles all cases, including when priorities are equal.
      return rightPriority - leftPriority;
    });
// ✅ Corrected dependencies: `prices` is removed as it's not used in this specific memoized value.
}, [balances]);
```

### Issue 3: Anti-patterns and Type Safety in `getPriority`
This function has two main issues: a lack of type safety and the use of an anti-pattern for handling fixed data. The parameter `blockchain` is typed as `any`, which bypasses TypeScript's safety features. Additionally, using a switch statement for a simple key-value lookup is overly verbose and difficult to maintain. The refactored code addresses both issues by using a constant object, which is more readable and type-safe.

#### Original Code:
```jsx
const getPriority = (blockchain: any): number => { // ❌ ANTI-PATTERN: The use of `any` defeats type safety.
  switch (blockchain) { // ❌ ANTI-PATTERN: `switch` is a verbose choice for a static key-value lookup.
    case 'Osmosis':
      return 100
    case 'Ethereum':
      return 50
    case 'Arbitrum':
      return 30
    case 'Zilliqa':
      return 20
    case 'Neo':
      return 20
    default:
      return -99
  }
}
```

#### Corrected Code:
```jsx
// ✅ Define priorities as a constant object for readability and maintainability.
const BLOCKCHAIN_PRIORITIES = {
  Osmosis: 100,
  Ethereum: 50,
  Arbitrum: 30,
  Zilliqa: 20,
  Neo: 20,
  Default: -99,
} as const;

// ✅ The function is now type-safe and uses a simple, readable object lookup.
const getPriority = (blockchain: string): number => {
  return BLOCKCHAIN_PRIORITIES[blockchain as keyof typeof BLOCKCHAIN_PRIORITIES] ?? BLOCKCHAIN_PRIORITIES.Default;
};
```

### Issue 4: Inefficient and Unstable Data Mapping
This code performs two separate map operations, leading to wasted computation and memory allocation for the intermediate `formattedBalances` array, which is never directly used. Additionally, the second map operation uses the array `index` as a component key, which is an anti-pattern that can cause inconsistent rendering and bugs, especially when the list changes.

#### Original Code:
```jsx
 // ❌ ANTI-PATTERN: This intermediate array is created but never used, leading to wasted computation.
const formattedBalances = sortedBalances.map((balance: WalletBalance) => {
  return {
    ...balance,
    // ❌ ERROR: `toFixed()` without an argument defaults to 0 decimal places, which might not be the desired format for a currency or balance value.
    formatted: balance.amount.toFixed()
  }
})

const rows = sortedBalances.map((balance: FormattedWalletBalance, index: number) => {
  const usdValue = prices[balance.currency] * balance.amount;
  return (
    <WalletRow
      className={classes.row}
      key={index} // ❌ ANTI-PATTERN: Using the array index as a key can lead to inconsistent rendering and bugs.
      amount={balance.amount}
      usdValue={usdValue}
      formattedAmount={balance.formatted}
    />
  )
})
```

#### Corrected Code:
```jsx
// ✅ REFACTORING: The entire data processing pipeline is now integrated into a single `useMemo` block that generates the final `rows`.
// The `filter` and `sort` was from the `sortedBalances`.
const rows = useMemo(() => {
  return balances
    .filter(...)
    .sort(...)
    .map((balance: WalletBalance) => {
      const usdValue = prices[balance.currency] * balance.amount;
      const formattedAmount = balance.amount.toFixed(2); // ✅ `toFixed()` was changed to `toFixed(2)` for consistent formatting.

      return (
        <WalletRow
          key={`${balance.blockchain}-${balance.currency}`} // ✅ A stable, unique key is now used.
          amount={balance.amount}
          usdValue={usdValue}
          formattedAmount={formattedAmount}
        />
      );
    });
}, [balances, prices]);
```
